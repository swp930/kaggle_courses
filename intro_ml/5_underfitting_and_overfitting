Overfitting
    Model matches training data almost perfectly, but does poorly in validation and other data.

Underfitting
    Model fils to capture important distinctions and patterns in the data.

max_leaf_nodes argument provides a sensible way to control overfitting vs underfitting

from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor

Compare MAE scores from different values of max_leaf_nodes
def get_mae(max_leaf_nodes, train_X, val_X, train_y, val_y):
    model = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_leaf_nodes=max_leaf_nodes, random_state=0)
    model.fit(train_X, train_y)
    preds_val = model.predict(val_X)
    mae = mean_absolute_error(val_y, preds_val)
    return(mae)

Can use for-loop to compare accuracy of models
# compare MAE with differing values of max_leaf_nodes
for max_leaf_nodes in [5, 50, 500, 5000]:
    my_mae = get_mae(max_leaf_nodes, train_X, val_X, train_y, val_y)
    print("Max leaf nodes: %d  \t\t Mean Absolute Error:  %d" %(max_leaf_nodes, my_mae))
