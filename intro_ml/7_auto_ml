7 steps of machine learning

Step 1: Gather the data 
Step 2: Prepare the data - Deal with missing values and categorical data
Step 3: Select a model
Step 4: Train the model - Fit decision trees and random forests to patterns in training data 
Step 5: Evaluate the model - Use validation set to assess how well a trained model performs on unseen data
Step 6: Tune parameters - Tune params to get better performance from XGBoost models
Step 7: Get predictions - Generate predictions with a trained model
