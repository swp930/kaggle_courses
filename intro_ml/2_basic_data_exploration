First step in machine learning project is to familiarize yourself with the data.
You can use the Pandas library for this. 
This library is the primary tool data scientists use for exploring and manipulating data.

Can import with 
    import pandas as pd

Most important part of the Pandas library is the DataFrame. 
DataFrame holds the type of data you might think of as a table.
Similar to a sheet in Excel, or a table in a SQL database.

Code snippet to read csv data and store as Pandas dataframe
# save filepath to variable for easier access
melbourne_file_path = '../input/melbourne-housing-snapshot/melb_data.csv'
# read the data and store data in DataFrame titled melbourne_data
melbourne_data = pd.read_csv(melbourne_file_path) 
# print a summary of the data in Melbourne data
melbourne_data.describe()
