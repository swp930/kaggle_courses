Selecting Data for Modeling 

Dataset had too many variables to wrap your head around or print
How can you pare down data to something you can understand?

Will use intuition to choose variables for now.

Have to examine columns of pd Dataframe

import pandas as pd

melbourne_file_path = '../input/melbourne-housing-snapshot/melb_data.csv'
melbourne_data = pd.read_csv(melbourne_file_path) 
melbourne_data.columns
