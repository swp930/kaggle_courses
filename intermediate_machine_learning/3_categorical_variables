A categorical variable takes only a limited number of values.

- Consider a survey that asks how often you eat breakfaast
    Categories would be "Never", "Rarely", "Most days", or "Every day"

3 approaches 
    1) Drop Categorical Variables
        Easiest approach when dealing with categorical variables
    2) Label Encoding 
        Assigns each unique value to a different integer. 
        There ends up being a ranking in the categories. 
        Categorical variables with ranking are known as ordinal variables. 
        For tree-based models, label encoding works well with ordinal variables.
    3) One-Hot Encoding 
        One-hot encoding creates new columns indicating the presence of 
        each possible value in the original data. 
        Categorical variables without an intrinsic ranking are known as nominal variables.
    
# Get list of categorical variables
s = (X_train.dtypes == 'object')
object_cols = list(s[s].index)

print("Categorical variables:")
print(object_cols)
