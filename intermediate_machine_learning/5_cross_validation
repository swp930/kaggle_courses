In cross-validatio, we run our modeling process on different subsets of the data to get multiple measures of model quality.

When should you use cross-validation?
- Gives a more accurate measure of model quality 
Should use this for small datasets.

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer

my_pipeline = Pipeline(steps=[('preprocessor', SimpleImputer()),
                              ('model', RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=50,
                                                              random_state=0))
                             ])

from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

# Multiply by -1 since sklearn calculates *negative* MAE
scores = -1 * cross_val_score(my_pipeline, X, y,
                              cv=5,
                              scoring='neg_mean_absolute_error')

print("MAE scores:\n", scores)
