tackle data types often found in real-world datasets (missing values, categorical variables),
design pipelines to improve the quality of your machine learning code,
use advanced techniques for model validation (cross-validation),
build state-of-the-art models that are widely used to win Kaggle competitions (XGBoost), and
avoid common and important data science mistakes (leakage).
