Approaches to dealing with missing values

3 approaches:
    1) Simple option: Drop options with missing values
        Model loses access to a lot of information with this approach
    2) Better option: Imputation
        Imputation fills in missing info with some number. 
        Can for example fill in mean value along each column.
    3) Extension to Imputation
        Can improve on imputation by adding an extra column that shows the location of imputed entries.

If you don't have more than 20% of a column's values missing then it's better to do imputation.

Approach 1: Drop Columns with Missing Values
# Get names of columns with missing values
cols_with_missing = [col for col in X_train.columns
                     if X_train[col].isnull().any()]

# Drop columns in training and validation data
reduced_X_train = X_train.drop(cols_with_missing, axis=1)
reduced_X_valid = X_valid.drop(cols_with_missing, axis=1)

print("MAE from Approach 1 (Drop columns with missing values):")
print(score_dataset(reduced_X_train, reduced_X_valid, y_train, y_valid))

Approach 2: Imputation
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer

# Imputation
my_imputer = SimpleImputer()
imputed_X_train = pd.DataFrame(my_imputer.fit_transform(X_train))
imputed_X_valid = pd.DataFrame(my_imputer.transform(X_valid))

# Imputation removed column names; put them back
imputed_X_train.columns = X_train.columns
imputed_X_valid.columns = X_valid.columns

print("MAE from Approach 2 (Imputation):")
print(score_dataset(imputed_X_train, imputed_X_valid, y_train, y_valid))

Approach 3: Extension to Imputation

# Make copy to avoid changing original data (when imputing)
X_train_plus = X_train.copy()
X_valid_plus = X_valid.copy()

# Make new columns indicating what will be imputed
for col in cols_with_missing:
    X_train_plus[col + '_was_missing'] = X_train_plus[col].isnull()
    X_valid_plus[col + '_was_missing'] = X_valid_plus[col].isnull()

# Imputation
my_imputer = SimpleImputer()
imputed_X_train_plus = pd.DataFrame(my_imputer.fit_transform(X_train_plus))
imputed_X_valid_plus = pd.DataFrame(my_imputer.transform(X_valid_plus))

# Imputation removed column names; put them back
imputed_X_train_plus.columns = X_train_plus.columns
imputed_X_valid_plus.columns = X_valid_plus.columns

print("MAE from Approach 3 (An Extension to Imputation):")
print(score_dataset(imputed_X_train_plus, imputed_X_valid_plus, y_train, y_valid))
